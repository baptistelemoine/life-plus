# Life plus challenge Frontend

## Get Started

In case you want to run locally:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Tech stack

- React for UI rendering
- material-ui for components library
- Redux not used here for app state management, instead tried and really impressed by SWR [read more](https://swr.now.sh/) and react context api

## Tests

Run end-to-end tests using the great cypress tool.

Note: it covers really basics example here and we definitely should do really more in a realworld production application

```
npm test
```
